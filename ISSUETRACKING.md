## Issue Tracking

We use bd (beads) for issue tracking instead of Markdown TODOs or external tools.

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Find ready work (no blockers)
bd ready --json

# Find ready work including future deferred issues
bd ready --include-deferred --json

# Create new issue
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 -d "Description" --json

# Create issue with due date and defer (GH#820)
bd create "Task" --due=+6h              # Due in 6 hours
bd create "Task" --defer=tomorrow       # Hidden from bd ready until tomorrow
bd create "Task" --due="next monday" --defer=+1h  # Both

# Update issue status
bd update <id> --status in_progress --json

# Update issue with due/defer dates
bd update <id> --due=+2d                # Set due date
bd update <id> --defer=""               # Clear defer (show immediately)

# Link discovered work
bd dep add <discovered-id> <parent-id> --type discovered-from

# Complete work
bd close <id> --reason "Done" --json

# Show dependency tree
bd dep tree <id>

# Get issue details
bd show <id> --json

# Query issues by time-based scheduling (GH#820)
bd list --deferred              # Show issues with defer_until set
bd list --defer-before=tomorrow # Deferred before tomorrow
bd list --defer-after=+1w       # Deferred after one week from now
bd list --due-before=+2d        # Due within 2 days
bd list --due-after="next monday" # Due after next Monday
bd list --overdue               # Due date in past (not closed)
```

### Workflow

1. **Check for ready work**: Run `bd ready` to see what's unblocked
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work**: If you find bugs or TODOs, create issues:
   - `bd create "Found bug in auth" -t bug -p 1 --json`
   - Link it: `bd dep add <new-id> <current-id> --type discovered-from`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Implemented"`
6. **Export**: Run `bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl` before committing

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken that needs fixing
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature composed of multiple issues
- `chore` - Maintenance work (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (nice-to-have features, minor bugs)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Dependency Types

- `blocks` - Hard dependency (issue X blocks issue Y)
- `related` - Soft relationship (issues are connected)
- `parent-child` - Epic/subtask relationship
- `discovered-from` - Track issues discovered during work

Only `blocks` dependencies affect the ready work queue.
